## Inspiration

I need to share files or data between my phone and pc. I need something like airdrop. So I built this! you can check the live version [here](https://relp.now.sh)

## What it does

Transfers between computer and mobile, send messages, and make voice call. 

## How I built it

I built with reactjs, webRTC, simple-peer, socket.io, nodejs

## Challenge we ran into

I need to transfer files in chunks, at first it was super hard, but eventually I figured out how to transfer files in chunks. Messages are also end to end encrypted, this is my first project based on cryptography.
